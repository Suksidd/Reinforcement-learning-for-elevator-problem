# Reinforcement-learning-for-elevator-problem

RL is applied to a single-elevator and multi elevator system.

The mathematical model of the elevator system is described in detail, making the system easy to re-implement and re-use.

The design follows a markovs descision process and is extended with reinforcement learning.

An experimental comparison is made between the performance of the Q-value iteration and Q-learning RL algorithms when applied to the Elevator system.
